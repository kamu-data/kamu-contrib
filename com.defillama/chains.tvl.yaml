              # Total value locked per chain as tracked by DefiLlama.com
              This dataset contains time-series data about liquidity (measured in US Dollars) locked withing different blockchains.

              Columns:
              - `event_time` - timestamp for when this value was recorded
              - `chain_name` - symbolic name of the chain
              - `tvl_usd` - estimated liquidity (total value locked) in the chain measured in US Dollars

              See [DefiLlama API](https://defillama.com/docs/api) documentation for details.

              This data is ingested for prototyping purposes only, all rights belong to DefiLllama.com.

              ## Example Queries
              **Question:** What was the TVL of Ethereum on October 10th, 2023
              
              **Query:**
              ```sql
              select
                event_time,
                chain_name,
                tvl_usd
              from 'kamu/com.defillama.chains.tvl'
              where chain_name = 'Ethereum' and event_time = '2023-10-10'
              order by event_time desc
              limit 1
              ```

              **Question:** Chain with the highest TVL now
              
              **Query:**
              ```sql
              with latest_data as (
                select * from (
                  select
                    *,
                    row_number() over (partition by chain_name order by event_time desc) as row_num
                  from 'kamu/com.defillama.chains.tvl'
                )
                where row_num = 1
              )
              select
                event_time,
                chain_name,
                tvl_usd
              from latest_data
              order by tvl_usd desc
              limit 1
              ```

              Note that because data for today may not yet exist in the dataset we use `latest_data` CTE instead of comparing to `now()`.
