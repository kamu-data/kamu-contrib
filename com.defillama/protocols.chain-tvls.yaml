              # Total value locked per protocol per chain as tracked by DefiLlama.com
              This dataset contains time-series data about liquidity (measured in US Dollars) locked withing different protocols, broken down by individual blockchains these protocols operate on.

              Columns:
              - `event_time` - timestamp for when this value was recorded
              - `protocol_slug` - symbolic identifier of the protocol
              - `protocol_name` - canonical name of the protocol
              - `chain_name` - canonical name of the chain
              - `tvl_usd` - estimated liquidity (total value locked) in the chain measured in US Dollars

              See [DefiLlama API](https://defillama.com/docs/api) documentation for details.

              ## Example Queries
              **Question:** What was the TVL of Uniswap on Ethereum on October 1st, 2023?
              
              **Query:**
              ```sql
              select
                event_time,
                protocol_name,
                chain_name,
                tvl_usd
              from 'kamu/com.defillama.protocols.chain-tvls'
              where protocol_name = 'Uniswap V3' and chain_name = 'Ethereum' and event_time = '2023-10-01'
              order by event_time desc
              limit 1
              ```

              **Question:** Which protocol has the highest TVL on Ethereum now?

              **Query:**
              ```sql
              with latest_data as (
                select * from (
                  select
                    *,
                    row_number() over (partition by protocol_name, chain_name order by event_time desc) as row_num
                  from 'kamu/com.defillama.protocols.chain-tvls'
                )
                where row_num = 1
              )
              select
                event_time,
                protocol_name,
                chain_name,
                tvl_usd
              from latest_data
              where chain_name = 'Ethereum'
              order by tvl_usd desc
              limit 1
              ```

              Note that because data for today may not yet exist in the dataset we `latest_data` CTE instead of comparing to `now()`.

              **Question:** What is the current TVL of Uniswap V3 protocol?

              **Query:**
              ```sql
              with latest_data as (
                select * from (
                  select
                    *,
                    row_number() over (partition by protocol_name, chain_name order by event_time desc) as row_num
                  from 'kamu/com.defillama.protocols.chain-tvls'
                )
                where row_num = 1
              )
              select
                protocol_name,
                sum(tvl_usd) as total_tvl_usd
              from latest_data
              where protocol_name = 'Uniswap V3'
              group by protocol_name
              ```
