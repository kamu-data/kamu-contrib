              # Historical token prices information as tracked by DefiLlama.com
              This dataset contains time-series data about token prices of different tokens.

              Columns:
              - `event_time` - represents the exact time the token price was recorded
              - `symbol` - symbol of the token (for example `ETH`, `USDC`, `GRT`)
              - `chain` - name of the blockchain network (example: `Ethereum`, `Base`, `Arbitrum`)
              - `address` - token address on the chain
              - `decimals` - number of decimal positions the smallest indivisible token value is shifted by
              - `price_usd` - price of the token in US Dollars

              See [DefiLlama API](https://defillama.com/docs/api) documentation for details.

              ## Example Queries
              **Question:** What's the price of ETH on Ethereum as of October 10th, 2023
              
              **Query:**
              ```sql
              select
                event_time,
                symbol,
                chain,
                price_usd
              from 'kamu/com.defillama.tokens.prices'
              where symbol = 'ETH' and chain = 'Ethereum' and event_time < '2023-10-11'
              order by event_time desc
              limit 1
              ```

              Note that we are using a combination of range condition on `event_time`, `order by` and `limit 1` to get the latest record on or preceding the desired date.

              **Question:** Which token has the highest price now?

              **Query:**
              ```sql
              with latest_data as (
                select * from (
                  select
                    *,
                    row_number() over (partition by symbol, chain order by event_time desc) as row_num
                  from 'kamu/com.defillama.tokens.prices'
                )
                where row_num = 1
              )
              select
                event_time,
                symbol,
                chain,
                price_usd
              from latest_data
              order by price_usd desc
              limit 1
              ```

              Note that because data for today may not yet exist in the dataset we use `latest_data` CTE instead of comparing to `now()`.
