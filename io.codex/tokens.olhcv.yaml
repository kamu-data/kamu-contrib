                event_time,
                symbol,
                sum(volume) as volume
              from 'kamu/io.codex.tokens.olhcv'
              where symbol = 'USDC'
              group by event_time, symbol
              order by event_time desc
              limit 1
              ```

              Note the `group by` to `sum(volume)` across all networks.
