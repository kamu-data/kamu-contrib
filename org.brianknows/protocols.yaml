              # List of protocols tracked by DefiLlama.com

              Columns:
              - `protocol_name` - name of the protocol
              - `protocol_address` - contract address of the protocol on the corresponding `chain_name`
              - `symbol` - short symbol assigned to the family of protocols (non-unique)
              - `chain_name` - name of the blockchain network (example: `Ethereum`, `Base`, `Arbitrum`, `Multi-Chain` if the protocol spans multiple chains)
              - `description` - description of the protocol
              - `protocol_category` - classifies the protocol purpose (`Dexs`, `Yield`, `Liquid Staking` etc.)
              - `twitter_handle` - X.com (formerly Twitter) handle
              - `coingecko_id` - protocol identifier in coingecko.com
              - `coinmarketcap_id` - protocol identifier in coinmarketcap.com
              - `listed_time` - timestamp when this protocol was first listed
