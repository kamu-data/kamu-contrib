              # List of DeFi pools tracked by DefiLlama.com
              This dataset currently includes only the small subset of pools of interest.

              Columns:
              - `event_time` - timestamp when the data was recorded
              - `pool_id` - unique identifier for the liquidity pool
              - `protocol_name` - name of the protocol/project associated with the pool (e.g. `lido`, `aave-v3`)
              - `chain_name` - name of the blockchain network (example: `Ethereum`, `Base`, `Arbitrum`)
              - `symbol` - symbol of the token of the pool (e.g. `STETH`)
              - `pool_tokens_symbols` - symbols of the tokens of the pool (e.g. `STETH`)
              - `pool_tokens_addresses` - list of token addresses that underly the pool
              - `reward_tokens` - token addresses distributed as rewards
              - `stablecoin` - flag indicating whether the token in the pool is a stablecoin

              The `pool_id` column represents a unique pool ID in DefiLlama. It's internal and should be used for grouping and JOINs only. A human-friendly unique primary key of the pool is a combination of `(protocol_name, chain_name, symbol, pool_meta)` columns.

              Data source issues:
              - Except for the synthetic `pool_id` UUID DefiLlama doesn't provide a natural primary key for the pools, in future we should enrich this data with the pool addresses
              - `pool_tokens_symbols` column does not come from DefiLlama and has to be enriched manually

              See [DefiLlama API](https://defillama.com/docs/api) documentation for details.

              ## Example Queries
              **Question:** List all pools on Ethereum with their token symbols
              
              **Query:**
              ```sql
              select
                protocol_name,
                symbol,
                pool_meta,
                defillama_url
              from 'brian-knows/com.defillama.pools'
              where chain_name = 'Ethereum'
              order by protocol_name
              ```

              **Question:** Which pools on Ethereum involve stablecoins?
              
              **Query:**
              ```sql
              select
                protocol_name,
                symbol,
                pool_meta,
                defillama_url,
                stablecoin
              from 'brian-knows/com.defillama.pools'
              where chain_name = 'Ethereum' and stablecoin = true
              order by protocol_name
              ```
