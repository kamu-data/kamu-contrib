              # Historical DeFi pools yield and TVL information as tracked by DefiLlama.com
              This dataset contains time-series data about APY (annual percentage yield) and TVL (total value locked) of different DeFi pools.

              It currently includes only a small subset of pools of interest.

              Columns:
              - `event_time` - timestamp when the data was recorded
              - `pool_id` - unique identifier for the liquidity pool
              - `protocol_name` - name of the protocol/project associated with the pool (e.g. `lido`, `aave-v3`)
              - `chain_name` - name of the blockchain network (example: `Ethereum`, `Base`, `Arbitrum`)
              - `symbol` - symbol of the token of the pool (e.g. `STETH`)
              - `tvl_usd_value` - total value locked (TVL) in the pool measured in US Dollars
              - `apy_base` - base annual percentage yield (APY) offered by the pool
              - `apy_reward` - reward-based APY provided through incentives
              - `apy` - annual percentage yield (APY)
              - `il7d` - impermanent loss experienced over the past 7 days, if applicable

              The `pool_id` column represents a unique pool ID in DefiLlama. It's internal and should be used for grouping and JOINs only. A human-friendly unique primary key of the pool is a combination of `(protocol_name, chain_name, symbol, pool_meta)` columns.

              For these columns full history may not be available so you should use the last non-null values:
              - `apy_pct_1d` - percentage change in APY over the past day
              - `apy_pct_7d` - percentage change in APY over the past 7 days
              - `apy_pct_30d` - percentage change in APY over the past 30 days
              - `apy_mean_30d` - mean APY over the past 30 days
              - `apy_base_inception` - base APY since inception
              - `mu` - mean expected return for the pool, a key statistical metric
              - `sigma` - standard deviation of returns, indicating the pool's volatility
              - `volume_usd_1d` - trading volume in USD over the past day
              - `volume_usd_7d` - trading volume in USD over the past 7 days
              - `outlier` - flag indicating whether the pool has been marked as an outlier (`true` / `false`)
              - `price_trend` - expected price trend (example: `Stable`, `Up`, `Down`)
              - `prediction_probability_pct` - probability of the prediction in percents
              - `il_risk` - risk of impermanent loss in the pool (`no` or `yes`).

              See [DefiLlama API](https://defillama.com/docs/api) documentation for details.

              ## Example Queries
              **Question:** Show the APY and TVL of Lido's pool on Ethereum as of October 1st, 2023

              **Query:**
              ```sql
              select
                event_time,
                protocol_name,
                chain_name,
                symbol,
                pool_meta,
                defillama_url,
                tvl_usd_value,
                apy
              from 'kamu/com.defillama.pools.yield'
              where protocol_name = 'lido' and chain_name = 'Ethereum' and event_time < '2024-10-02'
              order by event_time desc
              limit 1
              ```

              Note that we are using a combination of range condition on `event_time`, `order by` and `limit 1` to get the latest record on or preceding the desired date.

              **Question:** Which pool has the highest APY right now?

              **Query:**
              ```sql
              with latest_data as (
                select * from (
                  select
                    *,
                    row_number() over (partition by pool order by event_time desc) as row_num
                  from 'kamu/com.defillama.pools.yield'
                )
                where row_num = 1
              )
              select
                event_time,
                protocol_name,
                chain_name,
                symbol,
                pool_meta,
                defillama_url,
                apy
              from latest_data
              order by apy desc
              limit 1
              ```

              Note the use of the `latest_data` CTE that makes sure we consider only the latest values per each pool when ordering by `apy`.

              **Question:** What's the best pool for USDC by APY?

              **Query:**
              ```sql
              with latest_data as (
                select * from (
                  select
                    *,
                    row_number() over (partition by pool order by event_time desc) as row_num
                  from 'kamu/com.defillama.pools.yield'
                )
                where row_num = 1
              )
              select
                event_time,
                protocol_name,
                chain_name,
                symbol,
                pool_meta,
                defillama_url,
                apy
              from latest_data
              where symbol = 'USDC'
              order by apy desc
              limit 1
              ```

              **Question:** What pool had the highest APY in the last week on polygon?

              **Query:**
              ```sql
              select
                event_time,
                protocol_name,
                chain_name,
                symbol,
                pool_meta,
                defillama_url,
                apy
              from 'kamu/com.defillama.pools.yield'
              where event_time >= (now() - interval '7 days') and chain_name = 'Polygon'
              order by apy desc
              limit 1
              ```

              **Question:** What are the best pools to invest in right now?

              **Query:**
              ```sql
              with latest_data as (
                select * from (
                  select
                    *,
                    row_number() over (partition by pool order by event_time desc) as row_num
                  from 'kamu/com.defillama.pools.yield'
                )
                where row_num = 1
              )
              select
                event_time,

                apy
              from latest_data
              order by apy_mean_30d desc
              limit 5
              ```
