              ## Example Queries
              **Question:** What's the latest trading volume of USDC token across all networks
              
              **Query:**
              ```sql
              select
                event_time,
                symbol,
                sum(volume) as volume
              from 'brian-knows/io.codex.tokens.prices'
              where symbol = 'USDC'
              group by event_time, symbol
              order by event_time desc
              limit 1
              ```

              Note the `group by` to `sum(volume)` across all networks.

              **Question:** What was the trading volume of USDC on July 24, 2024?
              
              **Query:**

                event_time,
                symbol,
                sum(volume) as volume
              from 'brian-knows/io.codex.tokens.prices'
              where symbol = 'USDC' and cast(event_time as date) == '2024-07-24'
              group by event_time, symbol
              ```
